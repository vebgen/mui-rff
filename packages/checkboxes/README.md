# checkboxes

A component consisting of check-boxes that you can use in a React-Final-Form.

It has two modes:

- editing a boolean field, where a single switch is shown and the value is
  toggled when the switch is clicked,
- editing an array of arbitrary values, where the value for the field will be
  an array of unordered values; weather a value is included in the array or not
  is indicated by the switch being on or off.

## Running unit tests

Run `pnpm nx test checkboxes` to execute the unit tests via
[Jest](https://jestjs.io).
